# Specification Quality Checklist: Smart Asset Allocation

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-08
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED - All quality checks passed

### Detailed Review

**Content Quality**:
- Specification focuses on WHAT (allocation percentages, risk bands) and WHY (user risk profiles), not HOW to implement
- Written for business stakeholders with clear user stories and measurable outcomes
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

**Requirement Completeness**:
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all requirements are fully specified
- All 10 functional requirements are testable (e.g., FR-002 specifies exact percentage ranges for each risk band)
- Success criteria include specific metrics (SC-001: "within 2 seconds", SC-004: "3-5 holdings", SC-005: "90% of users")
- Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no mention of specific technologies or implementation approaches)
- 4 user stories with detailed acceptance scenarios covering conservative, moderate, and aggressive allocations
- Edge cases documented for boundary values, conflicts, and extreme inputs
- Scope clearly bounded with "Out of Scope" section listing 8 excluded features
- 10 assumptions documented, 2 dependencies identified

**Feature Readiness**:
- Each functional requirement maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- User scenarios prioritized (P1-P4) and independently testable
- Success criteria provide measurable outcomes aligned with functional requirements
- No implementation leakage detected

## Notes

- Specification is ready for planning phase (`/speckit.plan`)
- Consider running `/speckit.clarify` if additional questions arise during planning
