## üîç Mobile Audit - Issues & Fixes Needed

### Critical Mobile Issues (P0)

#### Dashboard Layout & Width Problems
- [ ] **Dashboard page too wide on mobile**
  - Dashboard container doesn't properly constrain width on phone screens
  - Cards overflow viewport causing horizontal scroll
  - Issue: `App.tsx:251` - Dashboard wrapper needs better width constraints
  - Fix: Add `max-w-[100vw]` and ensure all child elements respect parent width
  
- [ ] **Performance chart causes horizontal overflow**
  - LineChart has `minWidth={300}` which forces horizontal scroll on screens < 300px
  - Issue: `App.tsx:535` - ResponsiveContainer minWidth property
  - Fix: Remove `minWidth={300}` or use conditional rendering for mobile
  - Alternative: Wrap chart in horizontal scrollable container with scroll indicators

- [ ] **Dashboard grid cards spacing issues**
  - Grid cards (`App.tsx:264`) need tighter spacing on mobile
  - Card content has inconsistent padding across breakpoints
  - Fix: Reduce gap from `gap-4` to `gap-3` on mobile, ensure all cards use `p-3 sm:p-4`

#### Radio Buttons Appearing as Ovals Instead of Circles
- [ ] **Radio buttons not circular on mobile**
  - Radio buttons in RiskAssessment form render as ovals instead of circles
  - Issue: `radio-group.tsx:29` - RadioGroupItem uses `h-4 w-4` (only 16px)
  - Root cause: `aspect-square` not enforced properly, width/height mismatch
  - Fix: Increase size to `h-6 w-6` (24px minimum for touch), add `flex-shrink-0`
  - Ensure `.radio-mobile-circle` CSS class properly applies `border-radius: 50%` and equal width/height
  
- [ ] **Radio buttons too small for touch targets**
  - Current size (16px) is below minimum 44x44px touch target guideline
  - Fix: Increase to at least `h-11 w-11` (44px) with proper spacing
  - Add larger tap area using padding on parent label element

### High Priority Mobile Issues (P1)

#### Form & Input Issues
- [ ] **Risk Assessment form mobile layout**
  - Radio button labels wrap awkwardly on small screens
  - Spacing between options too tight for accurate tapping
  - Issue: `RiskAssessment.tsx:358` - Padding needs adjustment
  - Fix: Increase `p-3 sm:p-4` to `p-4 sm:p-5` for better tap spacing

- [ ] **Input field keyboard handling**
  - Modal inputs might trigger zoom on iOS (fixed with 16px font-size, verify)
  - Input fields in dialogs need better focus/scroll behavior
  - Fix: Test and ensure all inputs use `text-base` (16px) on mobile

#### Chat Component Issues
- [ ] **Portfolio chat message bubbles**
  - Message bubbles use `max-w-[80%]` which can be too wide on small screens
  - Issue: `PortfolioChat.tsx:274` - Responsive max-width needed
  - Fix: Use `max-w-[85%] sm:max-w-[80%]` for better mobile readability

- [ ] **Suggested questions overflow**
  - Suggested questions container (`PortfolioChat.tsx:318`) has horizontal scroll
  - Scroll indicators not visible to users
  - Fix: Add visual scroll indicators (fade gradient on edges)
  - Consider vertical stacking on very small screens

- [ ] **Chat input area mobile optimization**
  - Send button and input need better mobile spacing
  - Issue: `PortfolioChat.tsx:336-345` - Gap between input and button
  - Fix: Increase gap to `gap-3` on mobile for easier interaction

#### Modal & Dialog Issues
- [ ] **ETF Detail modal mobile view**
  - Modal uses `max-w-2xl w-[95vw]` which is good but content might overflow
  - Issue: `App.tsx:479` - DialogContent needs scroll testing
  - Fix: Ensure all content within modal is properly wrapped and scrollable
  - Test with long ETF descriptions and holdings lists

- [ ] **Auth modal on small screens**
  - Modal content might be cramped on phones < 375px width
  - Fix: Add more responsive padding, test on iPhone SE size (320px)
  - Consider reducing modal padding to `p-4` on mobile

- [ ] **Landing page card layouts**
  - Feature cards could have better mobile spacing
  - Fix: Ensure grid uses `grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-3`
  - Add more vertical spacing between cards on mobile

#### Navigation & Header Issues
- [ ] **Header button spacing on mobile**
  - Header buttons might be too close together on small screens

  - Consider replacing hover tooltips with tap/long-press
  - Fix: Add mobile-specific tooltip trigger behavior

- [ ] **Performance chart data labels**
  - X-axis labels on line chart might overlap on mobile
  - Issue: `App.tsx:538-551` - XAxis tickFormatter
  - Fix: Reduce number of ticks shown on mobile or rotate labels
